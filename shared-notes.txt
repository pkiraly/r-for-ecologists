How to code in R?

1. Install a software package called RStudio in your own machine.

Please follow the instructions you can find here:
https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html#Install_R_and_RStudio

2. Use an online RStudio server via the browser.

a. A GÃ¶ttingen based RStodio server
https://rstudio.gwdg.de

RStudio server requires a special user account. Please try if you can access the above mentioned URL. If not you can consult the following document:
https://info.gwdg.de/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:services:application_services:high_performance_computing:account_activation
or you can ask help from support@gwdg.de

b. A general RStudio server
https://rstudio.cloud

3. Use an online Jupyter notebook:

https://jupyter-cloud.gwdg.de/

In Jupyter notebook each webpage is an interactive page, where you can write and execute program code. Among others you can create an R notebook as well. When you are logged into the server you will see a dashboard called Launcher. In the first line with the rightmost icon you can launch an R notebook.

4. If none of them works, you can still use the R command line tool
